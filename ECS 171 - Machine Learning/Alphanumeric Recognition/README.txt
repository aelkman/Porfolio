The NN folder contains the script I created using the Deep Learning Toolbox from MATLAB
Dataset used was from the char74k database of images of handwritten alphanumeric characters
Hnd included all capital and lowercase letters, as well as digits 0-9
We also created a HOG pre-processed dataset for comparison of results, and found much better performance with HOG
